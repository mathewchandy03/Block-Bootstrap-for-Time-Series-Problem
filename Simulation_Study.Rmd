```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We need all necessary functions:

```{r functions, echo = FALSE}
nmblk <- function(n, l) {
  b <- n / l # assuming that is an integer
  idx <- sample(seq(1, n - l + 1, by = l), b, replace = TRUE) # Sample between 1 and n - l + 1, 
  # separating by l, b times
  c(outer(0:(l - 1), idx, "+")) # Creates a vector listing random blocks of size l with starting points 
  # decided by idx
}

mvblk <- function(n, l) {
  b <- n / l
  idx <- sample(1:(n - l + 1), b, replace = TRUE) # Sample any starting point between 1 and n - 1 + 1
  # they can overlap
  c(outer(0:(l - 1), idx, "+")) # Creates a vector listing random blocks of size l with starting points
  # decided by idx
}

blkboot <- function(tseries, statistic, R, l) {
  n <- length(tseries) 
  ## observed statistic
  stat <- statistic(tseries) #stat stores a certain statistic of tseries using a function
  ## nonmoving block bootstrap
  nm.stat <- replicate(R, statistic(tseries[nmblk(n, l)])) # finds the statistic of nm bootstrap and repeats R times
  ## moving block bootstrap
  mv.stat <- replicate(R, statistic(tseries[mvblk(n, l)])) # finds the statistic of mv bootstrap and repeats R times
  list(stat = stat, nm.stat = nm.stat, mv.stat = mv.stat) # returns list of three values
}

do1rep <- function(n, theta, sd, l, statistic) {
  x <- arima.sim(list(ar = theta), n = n, sd = sd) 
  # sd is the standard deviation of the noise -> true_variance(X_t) = sd^2/(1 - theta^2)
  
  bt <- blkboot(x, statistic, 1000, l) 

  # Variance Stuff that isn't working
  # 95 % Confidence Interval for Variance -> Lower bound: (n - 1) * sample_variance(X_t) / chisq(.025, n - 1)
  # Upper bound: (n - 1) * sample_variance(X_t) / chisq(.975, n - 1)
  # sample_variance(X_t) = se^2 * n 

 

 # nm_lower_bound with quantile function
  
  nm_interval = quantile(bt$nm.stat, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))
  mv_interval = quantile(bt$mv.stat, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))
  
  nm_contains = FALSE
  if (nm_interval[1] < 0 && nm_interval[2] > 0)
  {
    nm_contains = TRUE
  }
  mv_contains = FALSE
  if (mv_interval[1] < 0 && mv_interval[2] > 0)
  {
    mv_contains = TRUE
  }
  
  c(bt$stat, sd(bt$nm.stat), nm_interval, nm_contains, sd(bt$mv.stat), mv_interval, mv_contains) 

  
    # returns statistics and standard error's for nm and mv respectively, standard error (sd(bt$mv.stat) is estimated as the sqrt(sample_variance(X_t) / n)
  
}
```

Let's conduct a simulation study with n = 100, ar = 0.5, and sd = 0.1 (var = 0.01)

```{r functions, echo = False}
options(max.print = 1000000)
ar1 <- function(x) cor(x[-1], x[-length(x)])
m1 <- function(x) mean(x)
nmcount = 0
mvcount = 0
nmchicount = 0
mvchicount = 0

sim <- replicate(100, do1rep(100, 0.1, 0.1, 10, m1))

my_summary <- function(x)
{
  c(rowMeans(x), sd(x[1,]))
}
my_summary(sim)
print(sim)

#Counts how many times the true statistic was found in the interval

```
