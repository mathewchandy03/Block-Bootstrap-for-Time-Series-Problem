# Block-Bootstrap-for-Time-Series-Problem
Block bootstrapping is a method that can be used for estimating a parameter of a time
series. It involves splitting a series into blocks (in order to account for the time
factor) and re-sampling the blocks to create many new bootstrapped time series.
This method becomes more effective as the length of the time series increases. 
The question for this study is how does one determine at what length the block
bootstrap method stops being effective to estimate a parameter of a time
series.
