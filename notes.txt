1/19 Notes
• Basic bootstrapping is used to find variance of a point estimate
• Involves re-sampling points from original dataset with replacement to form a new bootstrapped dataset, repeating this many times, and creating a distribution of a certain statistic calculated from each sample
• Block bootstrap is used for time series
• To account for time factor, series is split into blocks, which may overlap or may not overlap, and the blocks are resampled to create a new bootstrapped time series
• Problem of block size (large enough to preserve temporal dependence and small enough to have some variance)
• What is the largest time series necessary to be effective?
• Task: Create order 1 autoregression simulation with AR coefficient = 0.5 and size = 100

1/26 Notes
• Create a function that returns a point estimate and standard error
• Takes input: observed time series, bootstrap sample size, block size, and later a boolean: overlapping vs. non-overlapping
• After function is done, we can begin to work on simulation
• Problem: as time series length goes to infinity, block size goes to infinity, but ratio of block size : time series length must decrease

2/2 Notes
• B is bootstrap sample size or number of replications
• Review Block Bootstrap section from Statistical Computing Course

2/9 Notes
• Design a simulation study for a given sample size (time series length): 100 for example
• Returns point estimate and standard error
• Replicate 100 times, check if it recovers empirical statistic and variance
• Check if 95% CI is in fact 95% confident
• Adjust parameters (sigma (noise level), length of time series, play with block size, temporal dependence, nm/mv)

2/23 Notes
• Fixed standard error problem
• Need to test if standard error of point estimate recovers true standard error
• Construct 95% CI's with quantile function
• Play around with n, ar, sd, and l

3/23 Notes
• Start with n = 400, ar = 0.2, then gradually lower n and record coverage rates
• Write code in way that it can be called with one line (use replicate instead of for loops)

3/30 Notes
• Use 1000 replicates instead of 3 trials of 100
• Experiment with constant l
• Begin Writing Paper (Use Format from NBA Covid Bubble Analysis)

9/8 Notes
• Use Format from KS Test Paper
• ar = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6
• Research question: At what sample size of a time series is block bootstrap no longer an effective method for estimating variance?

9/15 Notes
• Sections: (Introduction (includes Literature Review),
• Include who proposed block bootstrap
• Look for sample size investigation for bootstrap
• Block bootstrap is a widely used method when there is temporal dependence and estimating the variance is challenging (can be used for hypothesis testing and estimation)
• But for a finite sample size it will not work as well as expected.
• It is necessary to know which sample size is big enough 
• What has been investigated concerning Block Bootstrap?
• Our study investigates what sample size is needed for Block Bootstrap to work?
• Look at optimal block size paper

9/22 Notes
• Coverage rate confidence interval (confidence interval for proportions), create plots
• Section 2: Review of Block Bootstrap
• Section 3: Simulation Study Design
• Use citation keys from Google Scholar
• Go through papers that have cited Goncalves, may be relevant

9/29 Notes
• Try AR = 0: regular sample or ignore warnings
• Set sigma term so that variance is same according to equation: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/103405/prove-expression-for-variance-ar1
• Create figures for Block Bootstrap review

10/6 Notes
• Keep figures for later, not in paper
• Repeat program with 4000 replicates

10/20 Notes
• Use same data and different methods (l = 10 vs l = sqrt(n))

11/3 Notes
• Remove sqrt
• Cut height of plots by half, add captions, facet grid
• Add 95% Lines

11/10 Notes
• Remove l = 10
• Focus on AR = 0, 0.2, and 0.4
• Try n = 32, 64, 128 ..., until starts to work
• Estimate mean as well as AR(1) Coefficient

11/17 Notes
• Clean up code

12/1 Notes
• Clean up code
• Make functions work for vector
• Investigate sigma

12/8 Notes
• Look at tapered block bootstrap
• Review literature about block bootstrap

1/12 Notes
• Try Centered Asymmetric Intervals (around original estimate and mean of bootstrapped estimates)
• Use 1000 Replications
• Focus on AR

1/19 Notes
• Applications of Block Bootstrap
• Introduce problem of sample size
• Some studies have done this, but nobody has done this
• We are going to do this study with a AR(1) process with several confidence intervals from the literature, which will be reviewed in section 2
• Set up notation in the beginning of review of block bootstrap
• Introduce block bootstrap procedure
• Based on theta-stars, how will we set up confidence intervals
• Use math mode
• Try overlapping blocks
• Use star instead of b, and bar for mean, n for sample size
• Simulation Study includes Methods, description of Design, and report of results
• Section 4: Concluding Remarks
• Try n = 100, 200, 300, 400, 500

1/26 Notes
• Define acronyms for types of intervals
• Put sigma second row
• Try phi = -.2 and -.4
• No stars for multiplication
• mean is 0
• We are controlling sigma
• Phi is experimental factor with three levels: -0.4, -0.2, 0, 0.2, 0.4
• Don't start a sentence with a symbol
• Constructing confidence intervals for three parameters of interest, mean, sd, and autocorrelation
• Look at their empirical coverage
• Discuss the figure, 1 paragraph for each level
• Summarize that all mu work at that sample size, sigma does not deteriorate
• Try n = 600
• Try nrep = 4000
• Come back to motivation which is what is a good sample size for block bootstrap, how big?
• Conclusion is that even for mu, a sample size of 500 may be necessary

2/2 Notes
• drop mbtCI
• drop altCI
• Keep 1st and 4th (estCI and BCACIest)
• https://statds.github.io/stat-writing/

2/6 Notes
• Before the period
• Punctuation for equations
• Present design for simulation
• Present results for simulation plots and comments
• Connect back to goal
• It is more common to have a positive phi
• What is the observation 1, observation 2 ... on list, and then organize them into paragraphs
• In discussion, compare two interval methods
