1/19 Notes
• Basic bootstrapping is used to find variance of a point estimate
• Involves re-sampling points from original dataset with replacement to form a new bootstrapped dataset, repeating this many times, and creating a distribution of a certain statistic calculated from each sample
• Block bootstrap is used for time series
• To account for time factor, series is split into blocks, which may overlap or may not overlap, and the blocks are resampled to create a new bootstrapped time series
• Problem of block size (large enough to preserve temporal dependence and small enough to have some variance)
• What is the largest time series necessary to be effective?
• Task: Create order 1 autoregression simulation with AR coefficient = 0.5 and size = 100

1/26 Notes
• Create a function that returns a point estimate and standard error
• Takes input: observed time series, bootstrap sample size, block size, and later a boolean: overlapping vs. non-overlapping
• After function is done, we can begin to work on simulation
• Problem: as time series length goes to infinity, block size goes to infinity, but ratio of block size : time series length must decrease
